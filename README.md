## About

  


## Usage

 `vagrant up`  Will first bring up the vagrant vm-s in order to act as a lab environment (servers and bastions), then proceeds to provision them. After it will set up a controller machine and run ansible in local mode to demonstrate the ssh jumps using the bastions.

## Note

This was developed and tested on macOS.
